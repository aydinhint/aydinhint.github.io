        <h1> Welcome to my first Webpage! </h1>
        <p>My name is Aydin Hinton, and I'm currently a Junior at <a href="https://www.bridgew.edu/">Bridgewater State University</a>.<br>
        For leisure I enjoy longboarding around campus, playing Video Games with my roomates, and spending time with my girlfriend.
        <br>I've recently fell in love with coding to make any type of program I can like arithmetic, games, websites, and more.</p>
